    <h1>How to Play</h1>
        <p>
            There are two buttons. Hit and stand. If you press hit, you will get a random card from a deck of cards.
            Then, you will be unable to pick that card until the deck is reshuffled (It will tell you when it is)
            The you add the number you get to your score. Ie. if you pick 3 of hearts, you add 3 to your score.
            If you pick the Ace, you have the ability to change its value to 11.
            If you pick the Jack, Queen, or King, the number becomes 10.
            Your goal is to get your score as close to 21 as possible, without going over. 
            Once you think you've got as close to 21 as possible, press the stand button. The computer will do the same thing 
            you did, and will try to beat you. If you beat the computer, you gain one point. If the computer beats you, it gains
            one point. If you tie, you both gain half a point. This is an endless game, which means no playing to a certain number of points.
            After each round, if you wish to proceed, press the "next round button"
            If you wish to reset EVERYTHING, including points, scores, and current hand, press the reset button.
            Just play until you want to stop, and stop then. Note: reloading the page will not give you any benefits. You will only receive your 
            current hand back. Just saying. If you wanted to cheat, then that's not a valid way. Note 2: Please do not go to console to cheat.
